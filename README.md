# Advent-of-Code-2022

I decided to go through this year's Advent of Code (2022) and see how much I could get done during my lunch breaks. The list is still incomplete, and I'm continuing to add more days as I get around to it. 

The inputs are saved as separate .txt files and are titled "input_x.txt"
